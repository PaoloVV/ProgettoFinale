      description:
        "Carbon dioxide (CO2) is among the greenhouse gases that contribute most to global warming. These gases present in the Earth's atmosphere capture the sun's heat, preventing it from returning to space.",

      title: "Methane",
      description:
        "Methane is, after CO2, the main cause of global warming. Although it is relatively easy to reduce emissions, the improvement is slow and small. Methane has a much shorter residence time in the atmosphere than CO2, but its effect is 84 times stronger.",

      title: "Nitrogen dioxide - no2",
      description:
        'It is an irritating gas for the respiratory system and eyes which can cause bronchitis and even pulmonary edema and death. It contributes to the formation of photochemical smog, as a precursor of tropospheric ozone, and contributes, by transforming into nitric acid, to the phenomenon of "acid rain"',

        "The main effects of global warming are the decrease in water availability and crop yields, the increasing risks of drought and loss of biodiversity, forest fires and heat waves.",

      title: "Polar Ice",
      description:
        "Sea level is a very sensitive indicator of climate change. Global warming in fact results in the thermal expansion of the oceans and the increase in the flow of fresh water into the sea due to the melting of glaciers and ice caps. The entry of fresh water into the oceans produces a further effect on sea level: it reduces the salinity and therefore the density of sea water, with effects on ocean circulation that are reflected in how sea level varies from region to region.",
